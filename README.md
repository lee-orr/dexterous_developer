A modular hot-reload system for Rust.

Docs for the latest release are available at: <https://lee-orr.github.io/dexterous_developer/>

You can also find [docs for the latest pre-release](https://lee-orr.github.io/dexterous_developer/pre) and [docs for the main branch](https://lee-orr.github.io/dexterous_developer/main)

## Features

- A CLI for building & running reloadable rust projects, including over the network (cross-device)
- Works directly with Binary crates!
- The ability to serialize/deserialize elements, allowing the evolution of schemas over time
- Only includes any hot reload capacity in your build when you explicitly enable it - such as by using the CLI launcher
- The capacity to create adapters for additional frameworks, allowing you to use Dexterous Developer tooling with other tools.
- Includes a first-party Bevy adapter
- Works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS
- On Linux, can be used to develop within a dev container while running on the main OS, enabling use of dev containers for games & other GUI apps.

### Bevy Specific

- Define the reloadable areas of your game explicitly - which can include systems, components, events and resources (w/ some limitations)
- Reset resources to a default or pre-determined value upon reload
- Serialize/deserialize your reloadable resources & components, allowing you to evolve their schemas so long as they are compatible with the de-serializer (using rmp_serde)
- Mark entities to get removed on hot reload
- Run systems after hot-reload
- Create functions to set up & tear down upon either entering/exiting a state or on hot reload

### Future Work

- Cross-platform hot reload - run a "hot reload server" on a development environment, and execute the application on a different OS
- Mobile support
- Browser-based WASM support
- WASI support
- Patching running libraries with intermediate compilation results
- Supporting the use of inter-process communication in addition to the current dynamic-library approach
- GUI-based launchers should be added, especially for mobile
- Supporting ECS hooks and observers in bevy

## Installation

Install the CLI by running: ```cargo install dexterous_developer_cli@0.4.0-alpha.3```. This installs 2 command line utilities:

- `dexterous_developer_cli` - used to build the project, potentially running it at the same time
- `dexterous_developer_runner` - used to run the project on another device

## Setup

You'll also need to add the appropriate dexterous developer adapter to your library's dependencies, and set up the "hot" feature. For example, if you are using bevy:

```toml
[features]
hot = ["bevy_dexterous_developer/hot"]

[dependencies]
bevy = "0.14"
bevy_dexterous_developer = { version = "0.4.0-alpha.3"}
serde = "1" # If you want the serialization capacities
```

Finally, you'll need to set up a `Dexterous.toml` file, that helps define some of the necessary elements - such as which folders should be watched for changes, and what features should be enabled. See the [example file in this repository](./Dexterous.toml) or the [book](https://lee-orr.github.io/dexterous_developer/) for more info.

### Bevy Setup

In your `main.rs`, your main function should become:

```rust
reloadable_main!((initial_plugins) {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(initial_plugins.initialize::<DefaultPlugins>()) // You can use either DefaultPlugins or MinimnalPlugins here, and use "set" on this as you would with them
    // Here you can do what you'd normally do with app
    // ... and so on
});
```

If you have a plugin where you want to add reloadable elements, add the following in the file defining the plugin:

```rust

impl Plugin for MyPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app
            .setup_reloadable_elements::<reloadable>();
    }
}

reloadable_scope!(reloadable(app) {
    app
        .add_systems(Update, this_system_will_reload);
});
```

The [Simple Visual](./adapters/bevy_dexterous_developer/examples/simple_visual.rs) example shows the basic use of the library, and the [book](https://lee-orr.github.io/dexterous_developer/) has more info as well.

## Running with Hot Reload

To run a hot-reloaded app locally, cargo install and run `dexterous_developer_cli` (optionally passing in a specific package or example).

To run the app on a different machine (with the same platform), cargo install `dexterous_developer_cli` on both machines, and then:

- run the `dexterous_developer_cli --serve-only` on the development machine
- run the `dexterous_developer_runner --server http://*.*.*.*:4321` command, ideally in a dedicated directory, on the target machine

## Running or Building Without Hot Reload

To build or run the non-hot-reloadable version of your app, just remember to avoid including the `hot` feature, since it's designed to work only inside a reloadable library!.

## Inspiration

Initial inspiration came from [DGriffin91's Ridiculous bevy hot reloading](https://github.com/DGriffin91/ridiculous_bevy_hot_reloading)
